Data We Collect

User IDs & Times: When you use /save, we record your Discord user ID, the track, the game mode (“Shrooms”/“No Items”), and your submitted time.

No message content: We do not store or read arbitrary message content. The Bot only processes slash-command parameters.

How We Use Your Data

To provide leaderboard functionality (saving, displaying, and deleting personal bests).

To filter out users who have left a server, ensuring leaderboards reflect current membership.

Data Storage & Security

Data is stored in an encrypted SQLite database (times.db) on the Bot host.

No external third-party services store or process your data.

Access to the database is restricted to the Bot application; backups are secured and encrypted.

Data Retention

Your saved times remain until you choose to delete them via /delete, /delete_all, or /delete_all_tracks.

If the Bot is removed from a server and later re-added, your data for that server is retained (unless manually removed).

Third-Party Sharing

We do not share, sell, or distribute your personal data (Discord IDs or times) with any third parties.

User Rights

Access & Deletion: You can view, update, or delete your data at any time using the provided slash commands.

Questions or Concerns: Contact the Bot owner on Discord or via email to request corrections or to ask about data handling.

Children’s Privacy

The Service is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors.

Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be posted here with a “Last updated” date. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
